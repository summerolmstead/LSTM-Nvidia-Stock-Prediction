Welcome to my final project for my introduction to machine learning class! This was a LSTM model I created with the goal to predict the Nvidia's stock trajectory.
I will say that this could be a better model if I add more statistical analysis to see the relationships/ patterns between each window. 
Furthermore, the result of this model is interesting because generally it only ever went up but had peaks of down so based on the previous simple pattern recognition
it though it would be a little down. However, 9 months later in reflection it only ever went higher. I hope you enjoy looking into my model to see
my first ever attempt to a stock price prediction!
