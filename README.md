Hello and welcome to my final project for my Introdcution to Machine Learning Class! This was my first ever attempt at stock prediction and first tiem making a LSTM as well. From gathering 
the data from Yahoo, we use a window of 90 days for each sequence to train our model on predictive analysis. This data is fairly interesting given Nvidia's stock itself typically was 
continuously going up then a little down which is why the results likely occured in the way they did. Looking back, I believe the model could have been more accurate if more advanced mathematics
was calcualted to see the trends for each window and how it predicts the next. However, the stock market is known to be hard to predict given the unknown factor typically correlated to 
the news of the company itself and if they are launching and new projects. Overall, this project was an insightful hands on experience of trying to make a stock prediction model for the first time!
